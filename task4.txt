Reflection on git workflow:

Atom is an alternative to the git workflow. It can do 
everything that the original GitHub can, but even more.  
I discovered that Atom featured a lot of customizations 
including various themes and audio settings. The function 
that was the most appealing to me was the search bar, I could 
search for anything and it would generally lead me to what I 
wish to seek. What I disliked about Atom was that it added 
many other files that created a confusion and overwhelmed 
my screen. GitHub presented a clear list of the files that 
were originally added by choice and had meaning like the 
README or the LISCENSE files. I believe that Atom would be 
better choice if someone was aiming to use workflows professionally 
and required many functions such as a search bar or a shortcut but 
I would personally chose GitHub over Atom because I like the idea of 
being able to do 1 function that is clearly shown and understanding it well.
